# Assignment 2

Create a program that creates a drawing that can change.

1. Create a fork of the Assignment 2 repository. Clone the repo to your computer.

2. Review this weeks class notes. You may also want to read more on using variables and conditional statements online.

4. Edit sketch.js to create a program that generates a drawing that changes every time the program is run. Thoroughly explore using variables, expressions, and conditional statements. Try to make a program that creates drawings with wide variation.

5. Take **two** screen-grabs of your program's output and add them to your `README.md`.

6. Sync your project in Github Desktop to publish your work to Github.

### Notes

- Create a representational drawing. A representational drawing will pose more of a challenge than an abstract one, pushing you to more deliberate coding.

- Practice using conditional statements with both `if` and `else` blocks. Practice using variables and expressions.

- Aim for having many elements in your drawing change every time you run your program.

- Consider your composition. Scale, Position, Contrast, Rhythm, Tension, Drama. Create a visually interesting image.

- Comment your code clearly. Use comments to create and annotate sections in your code. For this assignment it makes sense to break up your code by what each part draws.

- Document your work in the `README.md` file. This file is displayed when people view your project repository on Github. Be neat: double check spelling, make sure the link works correctly, take a clean screen-grab, etc. Consider adding some notes to the `README.md` about your code and drawing.
